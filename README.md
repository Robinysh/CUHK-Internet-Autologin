# CUHK-Internet-Autologin


## Requirements
Python3 is suggested, but through minor editing this code can be ran on python2.

Google Chrome has to be installed.
It is suggested to download the corresponding version of chromedriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

Install the dependencies from pip.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For WSL, install the chromium with:
```
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt -y install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```
Check the Chrome version with:
```
google-chrome --version
```

For Raspberry Pi, a chromedriver designed for corresponding ARM architecture is needed.<br>
In Raspbian Buster/Bullseye, replace the chromedriver binary in the cloned repo with:
```
sudo apt update

# You will get the latest driver in this step
sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver
rm -f ./chromedriver
ln -s $(realpath /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver)

# Update your chromium as the driver is locked to chromium version
sudo apt upgrade chromium-browser
```

## How To Use
Run the following command to start auto monitoring.
```
python monitor.py
```

You may also run the following command to test if the log-in function works.
```
python login.py
```

## Settings
Edit your SID and password inside `login.py`

Period for checking internet connection can be adjusted inside `monitor.py` at `SLEEP_TIME`, in terms of seconds.
